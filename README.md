# odin-links-and-images
1. Made the homepage and about page
2. Made pages and put the about.html page in there. Also corrected link to about on index.html so it would still work since about is now in a relative folder.
3. Added dog.jpg to the page from the images folder.
4. Added alt text to both about and index page dog.jpg images
5. Just adding text into the read me section so I can figure out how to properly write a git commit message in vscode.
